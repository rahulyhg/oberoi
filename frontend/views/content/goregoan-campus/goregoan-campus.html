                                <p>We are a happy school, because happy children learn better than unhappy ones. We are, as one parent described us, “the school that children run to in the mornings”. The warmth of this school is apparent the moment you walk
                                    through the doors, as is the energy. Our classrooms are seldom quiet, because they are filled with activity as children (and teachers) actively learn with enthusiasm. The engagement of the children is obvious; learning
                                    is a joyful experience which is energetically pursued.</p>
                                <p>Our children learn together, because research teaches us that a collaborative environment is the most fertile one for learning to grow. We are a happy, international learning community, flourishing in an extraordinary facility
                                    which is unique to Mumbai.</p>
                                <p>Our facilities and resources are outstanding because we believe children are very important.Our international and local teachers are skilled and dedicated because they understand how important children are. Our graduates
                                    score outstanding IB Diploma results, but that is just a part of the picture. At OIS, we do more than produce great results - we produce great people.</p>
                                <p>Come and join us, join the adventure!</p>

                        <span class="d-block">Philosophy</span>
                        <p>Oberoi International School believes that a dynamic program of student activities is vital to the educational development of our students. We believe that the athletic program at OIS should reflect and support the school’s mission
                            and core values. Athletics contributes significantly to the total development of every student. OIS serves our students through two distinct, yet mutually supportive programs: The Inter-scholastic Sports Program and the Intramural
                            Sports Program.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sport is integral to individuals, social and cultural development. At OIS, we model the enduring values of sport: Commitment, good sportsmanship, team work, responsibility, resilience, and healthy competition. We develop these
                            values by learning from our victories, our losses, the day-to-day challenges of practice, and our efforts to find balance between our academic, athletic, and personal lives. As teachers, coaches, and student-athletes, we strive
                            to excel by being clear on our common goals and by being loyal to each other and to our values.
                        </p>
                        <p>Through the inter-scholastic and intramural programs, we emphasize that participation in athletics is a privilege and we encourage all students to take part. With this privilege go certain responsibilities. We have high expectations
                            for behavior, commitment, academic achievement, and making healthy choices. In conclusion, through the OIS mission and core values our athletic program seeks to support our students as they strive to excel.</p>

                                <p>The ECA program is designed to provide our students with an opportunity to have enriching experiences beyond the normal school day. The primary goal of ECAs is for students to have fun while learning important life skills
                                    and developing mastery of certain skills. The program is not competitively driven, but instead, is focused on exposing students to new experiences and enriching their lives. ECAs will allow students to try new experiences
                                    or participate in areas they are already passionate about. Each ECA aims to be student centered and to maximize student participation in the activity.</p>

                                        <p>ECAs are activities run either by our school’s teachers or outside agencies. ECAs provided by our faculty and staff are called Internal ECAs and those provided by outside agencies are referred to as External ECAs.
                                            To facilitate communication between parents & providers, by default parent email addresses are shared with the providers of the ECAs which your child has chosen. Parents are advised to enroll their children
                                            only if they permit us to share their email with the vendor. We do our best to vet outside providers, but cannot guarantee that the services they provide are of the highest quality or value. Please read carefully
                                            to note the fees charged, the schedule and the resources which may not be included as a part of the fee. These details will be included in the course description which will be mailed via school announcements.
                                            There will be no trial period. Therefore if the student discontinues after the activities have begun we will not be able to refund the fee. If parents are not sure about an ECA, we suggest you opt for the one
                                            which you are confident about.</p>

                                            <p>SKG students may sign up for a maximum of one ECA, while all other students are permitted to sign up for a maximum of three ECA sessions during each semester. Please note that if an ECA meets on two days during
                                                the week it counts as two separate sessions.

                                            <p>Students on the athletic team or those who intend to try-out for a team should ensure that their practice schedules do not clash with the ECAs which they choose.</p>
                                            <p>The reason for these maximum numbers is that ECA spaces are limited and on a first come-first-served-basis, and OIS wants every student to have a chance to take the ECA of their choice. Unfortunately, even with
                                                this limitation, students may not be able to enter the ECA of their choice.</p>

                                                    are set by the providers and include service tax already. All fees for ECA must be paid at school prior to a child being able to attend an ECA.</p>

                                            <p>Fee payments may be made by cheques or bank draft, and should be made out to “Oberoi Foundation-ECA</p>
